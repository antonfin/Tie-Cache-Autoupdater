Tie::Cache::Autoupdater
--------------
Sometimes I need show in web rarely changes data. You may save it in memory, 
but you never don't know how long script will be work. For example, fcgi scripts
may work few days or weeks, but counters of database tables or site settings may 
changed more frequent in the day, each hour or each 10 minutes. I wrote package,
that help you cached data on fixed time.
